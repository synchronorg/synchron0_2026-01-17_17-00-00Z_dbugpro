### 🛡️ The Seed Concept
In the Tiangan model, any repository with the suffix **0** (e.g. `synchron0_...`) acts as a **Seed**. It serves as the genesis for a collection of isolated module repositories that will eventually be unified.

### 🔄 The Naming & Merging Loop
1. **Module Identification**: Individual components are developed in module repositories identified by their Tiangan suffixes (`synchron0`, `synchron00`, `synchronA`, etc.).
2. **User Collection**: The user (AdminP) selects which isolated modules are to be collected for the merging process.
3. **Suffix Removal**: During the merge into the `synchronorg` organization, the Tiangan suffix is stripped from the repository name.
4. **System Integration**: The resulting suffix-less repository (e.g. `synchron_TIMESTAMP_USERNAME`) represents the final integrated system.
